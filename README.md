Anchor Saking Example

Solana development has a decent ecosystem for the developers, but the lack of integration

with UI and a lot of boilerplate code brings a good space for the frameworks. Let's get to know

the swiss knife of the Solana program development - the Anchor framework.


Suppose you are familiar with Ethereum dApp development. In that case, you may miss a

convenient way to integrate with UI, test your code with functional and integration tests, deploy

and migrate program versions and some syntax sugar that speeds up the routine development

tasks. The Anchor framework covers all those drawbacks.
